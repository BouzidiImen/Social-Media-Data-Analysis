# Social-Media-Data-Analysis

In this repository, I will show how to do the tweet sentiment analysis based on the tweets I have collected. The general procedure is the following:

1. Tweet filtering 
2. Tweet text preprocessing 
3. Tweet representation 
4. Locate tweets based on their geoinformation
5. Model selection and sentiment classification
6. Result visualization
