# Social-Media-Data-Analysis

In this repository, I will show how to do the tweet sentiment analysis based on the tweets I have collected. The general procedure is the following:

1. Tweet filtering 
2. Tweet text preprocessing 
3. Generate tweet representation using FastText word embedding
4. Locate tweets based on their geoinformation(latitude and longitude)
5. Model selection and sentiment classification
6. Result visualization
