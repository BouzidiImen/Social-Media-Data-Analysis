# Description

This folder contains the codes about:

- how to generate topic modelling result for any subset of our collected tweet dataset
- how to create word clouds for any subset of our collected tweet dataset
- how to plot the treatment TPUs, not considered TPUs and control TPUs in the cross sectional study. You could request the TPU 2016 shapefile through the [Hong Kong Planning Department](https://www.pland.gov.hk/pland_en/). Then, you could use ArcMap to draw the 500-meter geographic buffers around the station. Then by doing the intersect analysis, you could get the treatment group, treatment not considered group and control group as shown in the paper.
