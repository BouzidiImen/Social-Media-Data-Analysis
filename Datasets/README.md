# Datasets Description:star:

This project mainly uses the following datasets

## 1. Geographic Shapefiles of Hong Kong

The [shapefiles](https://github.com/bright1993ff66/Social-Media-Data-Analysis/tree/master/Datasets/shapefiles) folder contains the geometric shapefiles for Hong Kong, which show the borderlines for the [Small Tertiary Planning Units](https://www.bycensus2016.gov.hk/en/bc-dp-tpu.html). The following figure shows the TPU units in HK: ![TPU Units](https://github.com/bright1993ff66/Social-Media-Data-Analysis/blob/master/Figures/HK_TPU.png)

## 2. Location of Mass Transit Railway(MTR) Stations in Hong Kong

The [station_location](https://github.com/bright1993ff66/Social-Media-Data-Analysis/blob/master/Datasets/station_location.csv) file contains the latitude and longitude information of MTR stations in Hong Kong. The geoinformation of these stations could be founded using the [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro). For more information about how to use this API to find these locations, please go to [this Python3 notebook](https://github.com/bright1993ff66/Social-Media-Data-Analysis/blob/master/Use Google Places API to Get Location of MTR Stations.ipynb)

## 3. The Emoji Dataset
